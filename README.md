DARE UK Sprint Project: Trusted Research Environment and Enclave for Hosting
Open Original Science Exploration

## What is TREEHOOSE

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) are secure computing environments providing
secure access to sensitive data for research purposes. HDR UK has a set of
[resources and guides](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/access-to-health-data/trusted-research-environments/)
explaining TREs in more detail in terms of health data research, although TREs
are not exclusive to health data.

TREEHOOSE is an open-source platform for deploying TREs on Amazon Web Services
(AWS). It will include open-source tooling to streamline building and operating
TREs on public cloud infrastructure whilst maintaining security and trust.

The recent
[Goldacre Review ("Better, Broader, Safer: Using Health Data for Research and Analysis")](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/624ea0ade90e072a014d508a/goldacre-review-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis.pdf)
highlighted the need for standardisation across TREs, ideally through the use of
open-source infrastructure.

### Development status

TREEHOOSE is under active development. It is suitable for anyone interested in
deploying a trusted research environment on AWS. Currently it has good support
for launching customised Windows Desktops, and limited support for Linux
workspaces with SSH access. All access is managed through a TRE web interface
which prevents unauthorised egress of confidential data.

Features include automated backups for researcher workspaces, secure egress
requiring approvals from data governors or other authorised personnel, and
budget alerts to help manage spending.

You can deploy a TRE on your own following the TREEHOOSE documentation, but due
to the active development we strongly encourage you to get in touch with us
first, either by
[opening a GitHub issue on this repository](https://github.com/HicResearch/TREEHOOSE/issues)
or by emailing `hicsupport@dundee.ac.uk`.

We can help demonstrate features of the platform and see how they match your requirements,
and discuss future enhancements.

## Use cases

TREEHOOSE was originally developed for use with confidential healthcare data
such as patient electronic health records, but is designed to be used and
customised for all research and analysis disciplines which require access to
sensitive data.
